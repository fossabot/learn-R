## Introduction to Bioconductor
Bioconductor is a collection of more than 1,500 packages for the statistical analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. Originally developed for microarrays, Bioconductor packages are now used in a wide range of analyses, including bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, ChIP seq, copy number analysis, microarray methylation and classic expression analysis, flow cytometry, and many other domains.

This session introduces the essential of Bioconductor package discovery, installation, and use.
